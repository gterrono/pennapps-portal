          <h2>We're huge - and growing</h2>

          <h2>40 hours of hacking</h2>
          <p>The only thing you'll need to worry about when you get here is hacking. We'll take care of the rest: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, (energy) drinks, some awesome PennApps and sponsor swag, a place to sleep - all free.</p>

          <h2>Open to all students</h2>
          <p>PennApps is open to current undergraduate and graduate students at all schools. Students at past PennApps have come from as far as Michigan, California, and even Switzerland, and we will be expanding even further across the globe come fall.</p>
